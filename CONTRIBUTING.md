# Contributing to the Green AI Committee

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŒ±

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. 

If you like the Committee, but just don't have time to contribute more substantively on a project level, that's okay. There are other easy ways to support the work of the Committee and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:
> - Star Green AI projects
> - Tweet about the Committee and the work they do
> - Mention the work of the Green AI Committee at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues
